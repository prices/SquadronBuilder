# SquadronBuilder

## Introduction

This is a force builder for Robotech&reg; RPG Tactics&trade; 

The game can be found at http://www.palladiumbooks.com/

## Goals

The goal of this project is to create a web interface in HTML and JavaScript
that will allow a player to create squadron cards to play the game with.  The
squadron cards will be output is SVG format, which Firefox and Chrome will both
open natively.  From there they can be printed.

## Requirements
* A recent web broswer that supports JavaScript

I was thinking about the project, written in PHP, and realized that PHP was not
the right language.  Using JavaScript worked much better, as a web server is not
needed.  The files can just be opened in a web browser, and everything works.

## Testing

Just run phpunit in the root directory of the git repository.  It will Run
all of the tests automatically.

## Contributions
